## Why

At my work we use GitHubs compare feature quite a lot to make it easy for developers to review code that consists of several commits. I was tired of manually generating the GitHub compare urls. The process is tedious and it is easy to make misstakes.

Therefore I made this extension that simplifies the task. Enjoy!
